	which compare various methods, NN sets, and salt corrections. 

	version 4.1d

	documentation.

[29/JAN/2000] Nicolas Le Novère (nl223@cus.cam.ac.uk)

	Fixed bugs in the interactive mode. Improved online help (option
	-h).  Fixed a lot of bugs or unpleasant features in the option
	parsing.  Changed the behaviour of options -A and -H. The former
	has now always precedence over the latter regarding the et of NN
	parameters.

[27/JAN/2000] Nicolas Le Novère (nl223@cus.cam.ac.uk)

	Second beta version. Correction of some NN files. Modifications of
	documentation.

[26/JAN/2000] Nicolas Le Novère (nl223@cus.cam.ac.uk)

	hybridisations. Correction of a bug in the screening of
	Crick'pair.

[24/JAN/2000] Nicolas Le Novère (nl223@cus.cam.ac.uk)

	alpha5. The program can now read a file containing the
	nearest-neighbor parameters for some mismatched Crick's pairs.

[18/JAN/2000] Nicolas Le Novère (nl223@cus.cam.ac.uk) 

	on suggestion of Nicolas Joly (njoly@pasteur.fr) alpha3 and
	alpha4. Code correction only.
	
[17/JAN/2000] Nicolas Le Novère (nl223@cus.cam.ac.uk)

	alpha2. Modified the system to localize files containing set of nn
	parameters. Now a directory is defined at compilation by
	preprocessor directive. However, an environment variable can be
	defined, which targets a directory where to find a nn file. If it
	was not found there, it will be searched in the default
	directory. Therefore, a user can define its own set of parameters,
	while still using those installed with melting.
