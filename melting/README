[INSTALLATION]

Unbundle the distribution in the proper place (e.g. /usr/local/ or c:\Program
Files) and the file melting-gui.desktop in /usr/share/applications. 

Some pre-compiled binaries are located in the directory BIN.  If no binary
suitable for your OS is provided, or if you want to compile the programme
yourself (a good idea), edit the file 'SRC/makefile' to suit your needs
(particularly the default path for the files containing the nearest- neighbor
parameters). Please send me a copy of the binary if it is not already in the BIN
directory (send also the makefile).

UNICES 

Copy the file `makefile.unices' as `makefile'. Type `make' to compile the
program. Type `make install' to install the files in the proper directories
specified within the makefile. Type `make clean' to wash out the useless files.
The manpage melting.1 is moved in the proper location during the
installation. The other files can stay in DOC or the entire DOC directory can be
moved under the name melting in /usr/doc or an equivalent directory.

WINDOWS

Copy the file `makefile.dos' as `makefile'. Type `make' to compile the
program. Type `make clean' to wash out the useless files. The documentation is
located in the directory DOC. The files containing the nearest-neighbor
parameters are located in the directory NNFILES. Move them in the proper
directory specified in the makefile (variable NN_DIR).

[EXECUTION]

READ THE DOCUMENTATION BEFORE TO RUN THE PROGRAMME. 

The executable versions do not require any particular external libraries, 
and must run directly. Go to the directory containing the programme and 
type './melting [options]' under Unixes and 'melting.exe [options]' under 
DOS/Windows. 

You can also put the executable in a directory present in your PATH 
variable in order to use the programme wherever you are. The environment 
variable NN_PATH can be set to the directory containing your personal 
nearest-neighbor parameters. For instance in the bash:

export NN_PATH=$HOME/LIB/MELTING/NNFILES

In a graphical environment you can also launch melting by clicking on an 
icon linked to the program (the command-line options can then be entered 
through the properties of the icon, generally in the 'execute' or 'run' 
entry).

Type 'melting -h' to get a summary of options.

The directory TEST contains files with measured Tm from the literature.
They are useful only for testing the different sets of NN, the corrections
of salt concentration etc.

[SCRIPTS OF EXTENSION]

Some perl scripts are provided to perform repetitive tasks. Open them 
(with a text editor) to know how to use them.

A perl/Tk graphical interface is also provided. The files tkmelting.ptk,
melting.hlp and the binary melting have to be located in the same 
directory. run melting.ptk to launch the application.

Of course, you need Perl and Perl/Tk on your machine. Unices users can 
easily find those programs on their distribution. For Win32 users, Perl 
distributions containing Tk can be find either at the URL
ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN/modules/by-authors/Gurusamy_Sarathy
or from ActiveState (www.activestate.com). Note that in the latter case, Tk is
not installed by default.
