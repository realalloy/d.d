.SH NAME
melting \- nearest-neighbor computation of nucleic acid hybridation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B melting 
[\fIoptions\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Melting 
computes, for a nucleic acid duplex, the enthalpy and the entropy of the
helix-coil transition, and then its melting temperature.
Three types of hybridisation are possible: DNA/DNA, DNA/RNA, and RNA/RNA. 
The program uses the method of nearest-neighbors. The set of thermodynamic
parameters can be easely changed, for instance following an experimental 
breakthrough. Melting is a free program in both sense of the term. It comes 
with no cost and it is open-source. In addition it is coded in ISO C and 
can be compiled on any operating system. Some perl scripts are provided 
to show how melting can be used as a block to construct more ambitious
programs.
.SH OPTIONS
The options are treated sequentially. If there is a conflict between
the value of two options, the latter normally erases the former.
.TP
.BI "\-A" "file.nn"
Informs the program to use 
.I file.nn 
as an alternative set of nearest-neighbor parameters, rather than the
default for the specified hybridisation type. The standard
distribution of melting provides some files ready-to-use: 
.I all97a.nn
(Allawi et al 1997),
.I bre86a.nn
(Breslauer et al 1986),
.I san96a.nn
(SantaLucia et al 1996),
.I sug96a.nn
(Sugimoto et al 1996)
.Isan04a.nn
(Santalucia et al 2004) 
(DNA/DNA),
.I fre86a.nn
(Freier et al 1986),
.I  xia98a.nn
(Xia et al 1998),
(RNA/RNA), and 
.I sug95a.nn
(Sugimoto et al 1995),
(DNA/RNA).

The program will look for the file in a directory specified during the
installation. However, if an environment variable NN_PATH is defined, melting will search in
this one first. Be careful, the option 
.B \-A  
changes the default parameter set defined by the option 
.B \-H.
.TP
.BI "\-C" "complementary_sequence"
Enters the complementary sequence, from 3' to 5'. This option is mandatory if there are mismatches 
between the two strands. If it is not used, the program will compute it 
as the complement of the sequence entered with the option 
.B \-S.
.TP
.BI "\-D" "dnadnade.nn"
Informs the program to use the file 
.I dnadnade.nn
to compute the contribution 
of dangling ends to the thermodynamic of helix-coil transition. The dangling ends
are not taken into account by the approximative mode. 
.TP
.BI "\-F" "factor"
This is the a correction factor used to modulate the effect of the  nucleic acid concentration 
in the computation of the melting temperature. See section ALGORITHM for details.
.TP
.BI "\-G" "x.xxe-xx"
Magnesium  concentration  (No maximum concentration for the moment). The effect  
   of  ions  on  thermodynamic  stability  of nucleic  acid duplexes is complex,
   and the correct­ing functions are  at  best rough  approximations.The published 
   Tm  correction formula for divalent Mg2+ ions of  Owczarzy  et al(2008) can
   take in account the competitive binding of monovalent and divalent ions on DNA. 
   However this formula is only for DNA duplexes.
.TP
.B \-h
Displays a short help and quit with EXIT_SUCCESS.
.TP
.BI "\-H" "hybridisation_type"
Specifies the hybridisation type. This will set the nearest-neighbor set to use if no alternative 
set is provided by the option 
.B \-A
(remember the options are read sequentially). Moreover this parameter determines 
the equation to use if the sequence length exceeds the limit of application of 
the nearest-neighbor approach (arbitrarily set up by the author). Possible values are 
.I dnadna,
.I dnarna
and 
.I rnadna 
(synonymous), and
.I rnarna.
For reasons of compatibility the values of the previous versions of melting
.I A,B,C,F,R,S,T,U,W
are still available although 
.B strongly 
deprecated. Use the option
.B \-A
to require an alternative set of thermodynamic parameters. IMPORTANT: If the duplex is a DNA/RNA heteroduplex, the sequence of the DNA strand has to be entered
with the option 
.B \-S.
.TP
.BI "\-I" "input_file"
Provides the name of an input file containing the parameters of the run. The input 
has to contain one parameter per line, formatted as in the command line. The order 
is not important, as well as blank lines. example:

###beginning###
.br
-Hdnadna
.br
-Asug96a.nn

.br
-P0.0001 
.br
-v 
.br
-Ksan96a

###end###
.TP
.BI "\-i" "file.nn"
  Informs  the  program to use file.nn as an alternative set  of  inosine pair 
  parameters, rather than  the  default  for the specified hybridisation type. 
  The standard distribution of melting provides some  files ready-to-use:  san05a.nn 
 (Santalucia et al 2005) for deoxyinosine in DNA duplexes, bre07a.nn (Brent M Znosko 
  et al 2007)for inosine in RNA duplexes. Note  that  not all the inosine mismatched 
  wobble's pairs have been investigated. Therefore it could be impossible to  compute
  the Tm of a duplex with inosine pairs. Moreover, those inosine pairs are not taken 
  into account by the  approximative mode.
.TP
.BI "\-K" "salt_correction"
Permits to chose another correction for the concentration in sodium. Currently, one can chose between
.I wet91a, san96a, san98a. 
See section ALGORITHM.
TP.
BI. "\-k" "x.xxe-xx"
   Potassium  concentration  (No maximum concentration for the moment). The effect of ions 
   on  thermodynamic  stability  of nucleic  acid duplexes is complex, and the correct­ing 
   functions are  at  best rough  approximations.The published  Tm  correction formula for 
   sodium ions of Owczarzy et al (2008)is therefore also applicable to buffers containing Tris or
   KCl. Monovalent K+, Na+, Tris+ ions  stabilize  DNA duplexes 
   with similar potency, and their effects on duplex stability are additive. However this formula 
   is only for DNA duplexes.
.TP
.BI "\-L"
Prints the legal informations and quit with EXIT_SUCCESS.
.TP
.BI "\-M" "dnadnamm.nn"
Informs the program to use the file 
.I dnadnamm.nn
to compute the contribution 
of mismatches to the thermodynamic of helix-coil transition. Note that not 
all the mismatched Crick's pairs have been investigated. Therefore it could 
be impossible to compute the Tm of a mismatched duplex. Moreover, those 
mismatches are not taken into account by the approximative mode. 
.TP
.BI "\-N" "x.xxe-xx"
Sodium concentration (between 0 and 10 M). The effect of ions on thermodynamic
  stability of nucleic acid duplexes is complex, and the correcting functions
  are at best rough approximations. Moreover, they are generally reliable only
  for [Na+] belonging to [0.1,10M]. If there are no other ions in 
  solution, we can use only the sodium correction. In the other case, we use the Owczarzy's 
  algorithm.   
.TP
.BI "\-O" "output_file"
The output is directed to this file instead of the standard output. The name of the file 
can be omitted. An automatic name is then generated, of the form 
meltingYYYYMMMDD_HHhMMm.out (of course, on POSIX compliant systems, you 
can emulate this with the redirection of stdout to a file constructed with the program date). 
.TP
.BI "\-P" "x.xxe-xx"
Concentration of the nucleic acid strand in excess (between 0 and 0.1 M).
.TP
.BI "\-p"
Return the directory supposed to contain the sets of calorimetric parameters and quit with
EXIT_SUCCESS. If the environment variable NN_PATH is set, it is returned. Otherwise, the value
defined by default during the compilation is returned.
.TP
.B \-q
Turn off the interactive correction of wrongly entered parameter. Useful for run through a server,
or a batch script. Default is OFF (i.e. interactive on). The switch works in both sens. 
Therefore if 
.B \-q 
has been set in an input file, another
.B \-q 
on the command line will switch the quiet mode OFF (same thing if two 
.B \-q 
are set on the same command line). 
.TP
.BI "\-S" "sequence"
Sequence of one strand of the nucleic acid duplex, entered 5' to 3'. IMPORTANT: If it is a DNA/RNA 
heteroduplex, the sequence of the DNA strand has to be entered. Uridine and thymidine are 
considered as identical. The bases can be upper or lowercase.
.TP
.BI "\-T" "xxx"
Size threshold before approximative computation. The nearest-neighbour approach 
will be used only if the length of the sequence is inferior to this threshold.
.TP 
.BI "\-t" "x.xxe-xx"
Tris buffer  concentration  (No maximum concentration for the moment). 
   The effect  of  ions  on  thermodynamic  stability  of nucleic  acid 
   duplexes is complex, and the correct­ing functions are  at  best
   rough  approximations.The published  Tm  correction formula for sodium ions of 
   Owczarzy et al(2008)is therefore also applicable to buffers containing Tris or
   KCl. Monovalent K+, Na+, Tris+ ions  stabilize  DNA duplexes with similar potency, and 
   their effects on duplex stability are additive. However this formula is only for DNA 
   duplexes. Be careful, the Tris+ ion concentration is about half of the total tris buffer
   concentration.
.TP
.B \-v
Control the verbose mode, issuing a lot more information about the current run 
(try it once to see if you can get something interesting). Default is OFF. The 
switch works in both sens. Therefore if 
.B \-v 
has been set in an input file, another
.B \-v 
on the command line will switch the verbose mode OFF (same thing if two 
.B \-v 
are set on the same command line). 
.TP
.B \-V
Displays the version number and quit with EXIT_SUCCESS.
.TP
.B \-x
Force the program to compute an approximative tm, based on G+C content. This option has to
be used with caution. Note that such a calcul is increasingly incorrect when the length of 
the duplex decreases. Moreover, it does not take into account nucleic acid concentration,
which is a strong mistake. 

.SH ALGORITHM

.SS Thermodynamics of helix-coil transition of nucleic acid

The nearest-neighbor approach is based on the fact that the helix-coil transition works as a zipper.
After an initial attachment, the hybridisation propagates laterally. 
Therefore, the process depends on the adjacent nucleotides on each strand (the Crick's pairs).
Two duplexes with the same base pairs could have different stabilities, and on the contrary, two
duplexes with different sequences but identical sets of Crick's pairs will have the same 
thermodynamics properties (see Sugimoto et al. 1994). 
This program first computes the hybridisation enthalpy and entropy from the elementary parameters of 
each Crick's pair.

DeltaH = deltaH(initiation) + SUM(deltaH(Crick's pair)) 
.br
DeltaS = deltaS(initiation) + SUM(deltaS(Crick's pair)) 

See Wetmur J.G. (1991) and SantaLucia (1998) for deep reviews on the nucleic 
acid hybridisation and on the different set of nearest-neighbor parameters. 

.SS Effect of mismatches and dangling ends

The mismatching pairs are also taken into account. However the thermodynamic 
parameters are still not available for every possible cases (notably when both 
positions are mismatched). In such a case, the program, unable to compute 
any relevant result, will quit with a warning.

The two first and positions cannot be mismatched. in such a case, the result is unpredictable, and
all cases are possible. for instance (see Allawi and SanLucia 1997), the duplex

A          T
.br
 GTGAGCTCAT
.br
 TACTCGAGTG
.br
T          A

is more stable than

AGTGAGCTCATT
.br
TTACTCGAGTGA

The dangling ends, that is the umatched terminal nucleotides, can be taken into account.

.SS Example

DeltaH(
.br
AGCGATGAA-
.br
-CGCTGCTTT
.br
) = DeltaH(AG/-C)+DeltaH(A-/TT)
.br
+DeltaH(initG/C)+DeltaH(initA/T)
.br
+DeltaH(GC/CG)+DeltaH(CG/GC)+2xDeltaH(GA/CT)+DeltaH(AA/TT)
.br
+Delta(AT/TG mismatch) +DeltaG(TC/GG mismatch)

(The same computation is performed for DeltaS)

.SS The melting temperature

Then the melting temperature is computed by the following formula:

Tm = DeltaH / (DeltaS + Rx ln ([nucleic acid]/F))  
.br
.I Tm in K 
(for [Na+] = 1 M ) 
.br
     + f([Na+]) - 273.15                 
.br
.I correction 
for the salt concentration (if there are only sodium cations in the solution)and to get the temperature in degree Celsius.
(In fact some corrections are directly included in the DeltaS see that of SanLucia 1998)

.SS Correction for the concentration of nucleic acid

If the concentration of the two strands are similar, F is 1 in case of
self-complementary oligonucleotides, 4 otherwise. If one strand is in excess
(for instance in PCR experiment), F is 2 (Actually the formula would have to use
the difference of concentrations rather than the total concentration, but if the
excess is sufficient, the total concentration can be assumed to be identical to
the concentration of the strand in excess).

Note however, MELTING makes the assumption of no self-assembly, 
.I i.e. 
the computation does not take any entropic term to correct for self-complementarity.

.SS Correction for the concentration of salt

If there are only sodium ions in the solution, we can use the following
corrections:

The correction can be chosen between
.I wet91a, 
presented in Wetmur 1991
.I i.e.
.br
16.6 x log([Na+] / (1 + 0.7 x [Na+])) + 3.85

.I san96a
presented in SantaLucia et al. 1996
.I i.e.
.br
12.5 x log[Na+]

and 
.I san98a
presented in SantaLucia 1998
.I i.e.
a correction of the entropic term without modification of enthalpy
.br
DeltaS = DeltaS([Na+]=1M) + 0.368 x (N-1) x ln[Na+]

Where N is the length of the duplex (SantaLucia 1998 actually used 'N' the number of non-terminal phosphates, that is effectively equal to our N-1). CAUTION, this correction is meant to correct entropy values expressed in cal.mol-1.K-1!!!

.SS Correction for the concentration of ions when other monovalent ions such as Tris+ and K+ or divalent Mg2+ ions are added 
   
If there are only Na+ ions, we can use the correction for the concentration of salt(see above). In the opposite case
, we will use the magnesium and monovalent ions correction from Owczarzy et al (2008). (only for DNA duplexes)

[Mon+] = [Na+] + [K+] + [Tris+] 

Where [Tris+] = [Tris buffer]/2. (in the option -t, it is the Tris buffer concentration which is entered). 
      
If [Mon+] = 0, the divalent ions are the only ions present
 and the melting temperature is :
      
1/Tm(Mg2+) = 1/Tm(1M Na+) + a - b x ln([Mg2+]) + Fgc x (c + d x ln([Mg2+]) + 1/(2 x (Nbp - 1)) x (- e +f x ln([Mg2+]) + g x ln([Mg2+]) x ln([Mg2+]))
      
where : 
a = 3.92/100000.
b = 9.11/1000000.
c = 6.26/100000.
d = 1.42/100000.
e = 4.82/10000.
f = 5.25/10000.
g = 8.31/100000.
Fgc is the fraction of GC base pairs in the sequence and Nbp is the length of the sequence (Number of base pairs).
      
If [Mon+] > 0, there are several cases because we can have a competitive DNA binding between monovalent and divalent 
cations  :
       
If the ratio [Mg2+]^(0.5)/[Mon+] is inferior to 0.22, monovalent ion influence is dominant, divalent cations can be disregarded and the melting temperature is :
       
1/Tm(Mg2+) = 1/Tm(1M Na+) + (4.29 x Fgc - 3.95) x 1/100000 x ln([mon+]) + 9.40 x
1/1000000 x ln([Mon+]) x ln([Mon+])

where : Fgc is the fraction of GC base pairs in the sequence.
       
If the ratio [Mg2+]^(0.5)/[Mon+] is included in [0.22, 6[,
we must take in account both Mg2+ and monovalent cations 
concentrations. The melting temperature is :
      
1/Tm(Mg2+) = 1/Tm(1M Na+) + a - b x ln([Mg2+]) + Fgc x (c + d x ln([Mg2+]) +
1/(2 x (Nbp - 1)) x (- e + f x ln([Mg2+]) + g x ln([Mg2+]) x ln([Mg2+]))
      
where : a = 3.92/100000 x (0.843 - 0.352 x [Mon+]0.5 x ln([Mon+])).
        b = 9.11/1000000.
	c = 6.26/100000.
        d = 1.42/100000 x (1.279 - 4.03/1000 x ln([mon+]) - 8.03/1000 x
	ln([mon+] x ln([mon+]).
	e = 4.82/10000.
	f = 5.25/10000.
	g = 8.31/100000 x (0.486 - 0.258 x ln([mon+]) + 5.25/1000 x ln([mon+] x ln([mon+] x ln([mon+]).
       
Fgc is the fraction of GC base pairs in the sequence and Nbp is the length of the sequence (Number of base pairs).
       
Finally, if the ratio [Mg2+]^(0.5)/[Mon+] is superior to 6, divalent ion influence is dominant, monovalent cations can be disregarded and the melting temperature is :
      
1/Tm(Mg2+) = 1/Tm(1M Na+) + a - b x ln([Mg2+]) + Fgc x (c + d x ln([Mg2+]) +
1/(2 x (Nbp - 1)) x (- e + f x ln([Mg2+]) + g x ln([Mg2+]) x ln([Mg2+]))
      
where : 
a = 3.92/100000.
b = 9.11/1000000.
c = 6.26/100000.
d = 1.42/100000.
e = 4.82/10000.
f = 5.25/10000.
g = 8.31/100000.

Fgc is the fraction of GC base pairs in the sequence and 
Nbp is the length of the sequence (Number of base pairs).
   
.SS Long sequences

It is important to realise that the nearest-neighbor approach has been established 
on small oligonucleotides. Therefore the use of melting in the non-approximative 
mode is really accurate only for relatively short sequences (Although if the sequences are
two short, let's say < 6 bp, the influence of extremities becomes too important and the 
reliability decreases a lot). For long sequences an approximative mode has been designed. This mode is 
launched if the sequence length is higher than the value 
given by the option -T (the default threshold is 60 bp).

The melting temperature is computed by the following formulas:

DNA/DNA: 
.br
Tm = 81.5+16.6*log10([Na+]/(1+0.7[Na+]))+0.41%GC-500/size

DNA/RNA:
.br
Tm = 67+16.6*log10([Na+]/(1.0+0.7[Na+]))+0.8%GC-500/size

RNA/RNA:
.br
Tm = 78+16.6*log10([Na+]/(1.0+0.7[Na+]))+0.7%GC-500/size

This mode is nevertheless 
.B strongly disencouraged.

.SS Miscellaneous comments

Melting is currently accurate only when the hybridisation is performed at pH 71.

The computation is valid only for the hybridisations performed in aqueous medium.
Therefore the use of denaturing agents such as formamide completely invalidates
the results.

AGCGACGAGCTAGCCTA\\AGGACCTATACGAC
